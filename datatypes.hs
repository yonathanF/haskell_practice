-- Pattern matching

-- Pattern matching w/ wild cards

-- this will create a warning ???

-- remeber to cover all cases when pattern matching. If a case is not covered, it can cause runtime exceptions

-- writing getters and setters is annoying so better way:

data Employee = Employee {
  employeeID :: Int,
  employeeName :: String,
  employeeAddress :: Address

-- Parameterised types
-- data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
data SimpleType a = SimpleConst a | Nothing deriving (Show)

-- we can then create values like
firstType = SimpleConst "hello world of params"

secondType = SimpleConst 1

-- we can also nest things
nested = SimpleConst (SimpleConst "Nested!")

-- types can be recursive
data List a = Const a (List a) | Nil deriving (Show)

-- another example of a recursive structure, a b-tree
data BTree a = Node a (BTree a) (BTree a) | Empty  deriving (Show)

-- this recursively converst the List datatype above to a haskell list 
toList (Const b bs) = b : toList(bs)
