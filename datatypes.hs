-- Pattern matching

bookTitle (Book id title authors) = title
bookAuthors (Book id title authors) = authors

-- Pattern matching w/ wild cards

-- this will create a warning ???

-- remeber to cover all cases when pattern matching. If a case is not covered, it can cause runtime exceptions

-- writing getters and setters is annoying so better way:

  employeeName :: String,
  employeeAddress :: Address
                         } deriving (Show)
